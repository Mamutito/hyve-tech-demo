# HYVE Technical Assessment

## Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept for a technical test for HYVE. It validates my knowledge in Tailwind, React, React Router, and Redux Toolkit. This is only a proof of concept, and there are several improvements that can still be made.

A Figma link was provided with the test, and the structure has been mostly respected. However, I took the liberty of using some components from the `react-radix` library and icons from the `lucide-react` library to speed up the creation process for the test. In a real project, the original structure would be respected.

## Installation

To install the project, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

To start the project, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

## Running Tests

To execute the tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).
